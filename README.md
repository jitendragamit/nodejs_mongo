Prerequisites : 

1. Download and install node js and Mongodb on your VMs (Cent os, Ubuntu etc..)

2. create directory where you want to install node js 

3. Install node js inside the created directory using below command:

	e.g. npm install

4. Then run node server using below command : 

	e.g. node server.js	
	
5. After successfully run the above command test below url in postman or browser 

	e.g. http://localhost:3002
	
	By default node js run on 3000 port number, but if you have already any other application running on this port 
	then change port number, here I have changed the port 3002
